A latch is a kind of memory device that holds one bit of data. An SR latch features two inputs: S (Set) and R (Reset). It also includes an output named Q. The S input is used to activate the latch, while the R input deactivates or resets it.

As shown in the table, this is how the SR latch operates. However, by design, when both S and R are activated simultaneously, it results in an invalid input, making the value of Q undefined.
